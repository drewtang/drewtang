# Hi, I'm Drew Dillon üëã

**CEO & Founder at Brief**

## üöÄ About Me

I build AI infrastructure for product teams. With 19+ years scaling startups, I led Yammer's Product & Platform team (employee #60) from $1.5M to $30M ARR through Microsoft's $1.2B acquisition. Since then, I've worked with 20+ startups as fractional Chief Product Officer, consistently doubling engineering velocity.

Now building **Brief** - the AI Chief Product Officer that gives coding agents business judgment. Brief prevents catastrophic AI mistakes by providing context, decision memory, and priority intelligence to development teams.
